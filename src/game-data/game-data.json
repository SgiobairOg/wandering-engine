Basically all I have is knowledge of how you got here, a knack for narrating your life, and gobs of free time.\n\nAnyway, let's start. After fidling with a cursed looking rabbit in woods that definitely had a \"keep out\" sign-\n\n...\n\nYes, they did. There was at least one sign.\n\n*ahem* You find you have been transported to what you are soon to learn is a magical realm. Adventure awaits!",
